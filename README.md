This is the code repository for [Hands-On One-shot Learning with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/hands-one-shot-learning-python?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781838825461), published by Packt.

**Learn to implement fast and accurate deep learning models with fewer training samples using PyTorch**

## What is this book about?
This book is a step by step guide to one-shot learning using Python-based libraries. It is designed to help you understand and design models that can learn information about your data from one, or only a few, training examples. You will also learn to apply these techniques with real-world examples and datasets for classification and regression.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Get to grips with the fundamental concepts of one- and few-shot learning
* Work with different deep learning architectures for one-shot learning
* Understand when to use one-shot and transfer learning, respectively
* Study the Bayesian network approach for one-shot learning
* Implement one-shot learning approaches based on metrics, models, and optimization in PyTorch
* Discover different optimization algorithms that help to improve accuracy even with smaller volumes of data
* Explore various one-shot learning architectures based on classification and regression

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
# import small dataset
iris = datasets.load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you're an AI researcher or a machine learning or deep learning expert looking to explore one-shot learning, this book is for you. It will help you get started with implementing various one-shot techniques to train models faster. Some Python programming experience is necessary to understand the concepts covered in this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-4).
